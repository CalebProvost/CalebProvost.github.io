                <h3 id="projectConcept">Project Concept</h3>
                <p>Catena, a Latin derived word which Oxford Dictionary defines as "a connected series or chain." The
                    name of this project is befitting of the device as it connects real-world physical puzzles to each
                    other for a structured interactive experience.</p>

                <h3 id="Goals">Goals</h3>
                <p>My goal is to create a mobile device in which, modularly or otherwise, can interact with as many
                    sensors as possible without compromising the simplicity of its use. I hope to someday see it in the
                    "Escape Room" style interactive puzzle industry and contribute to the experience and expand upon the
                    possibilities of puzzles.</p>

                <h3 id="wishList">Project Wish List</h3>
                <p> Ideally I’d be able to make a small handheld device which could house every feasible sensor known to
                    man. That would be an accomplishment itself (especially for one person to do). So I know I’ll have
                    to compromise on something along the way, but I’ll do my best to incorporate as many as possible and
                    start eliminating when I come across limitations. So then, below are some things I’d like Catena to
                    do.

                    <br>Hardware wise, have:
                    <li> Memory large enough to accommodate RTOS and UX apps.</li>
                    <li> Mobility with enough power to accommodate around 2 hours of use (LiPo, or other?).</li>
                    <li> Wireless network communications for customer and end user information backups.</li>
                    <li> Light/color sensors (multiple spectrums) and emitters (laser sounds the most useful for
                        puzzles).</li>
                    <li> Temp sensors (internally for device safety) *struggling to think of safe ways a puzzle would
                        incorporate heat differences to justify external temp sensors*.</li>
                    <li> Pressure feedback (pressure switches maybe).</li>
                    <li> Accelerometer (for movement as well as gravity sensor. Think angular positioning).</li>
                    <li> Microphone or Piezo-electric sensors.</li>
                    <li>1 Ghz or faster processor.</li>
                    <li> Expandable memory, or internal large enough to accommodate hours of video and audio files.</li>
                    <li> Speakers (not sure quality is necessary).</li>
                    <li> Radio Frequency transmitter (NFC would work).</li>
                    <li> DC motor(s). *small for vibration feedback or even inner-compartment lever*</li>
                    <li> Keyboard (could be eliminated for digital replacement, however, I’m concerned the display will
                        be masked too much).</li>
                    <li> Case accessible buttons (like volume or laser on, etc).</li>
                    <li> Handheld Display.</li>
                    <li> Camera(s). </li>
                    <li> GPS/WLAN? *not sure if I see this as necessary, unless it’s also marketed as a geocaching game
                        device*</li>
                    <li> Indicator LEDs.</li>
                    <li> Magnetic sensors (Hall-effect) *could be used for cheaper puzzles by the customer*.</li>

                    <br>Software:
                    <li> Firmware to operate hardware.</li>
                    <li>Customized OS to eliminate end user manipulation (modified Linux?).</li>
                    <li> Diagnostics app for one source testing all hardware (potentially a hidden boot partition which
                        loads directly to this as well).</li>
                    <li> Server backend software.</li>
                    <li> Customer story setup software. *guided mode and advance mode options*</li>
                    <li> End user application (prompts at given times, tip request features [set with predetermined tips
                        or pager feature for assistance], revisit clues, notes segment, etc). </li>
                </p>

                <h3 id="startingPoint"> Starting Point Decisions </h3>
                <p> Prototyping Board:<br>
                    I’ve chosen to go with the BeagleBone Black Wireless (BBBW) as its embedded ARM SoC meets many
                    features I wanted to have already, and has many resources which will allow for faster prototyping.
                    With all the open ware and open licenses, I can continue onto creating my own custom board after as
                    well. This means I have an added goal of designing a single board computer of my own which will
                    incorporate all the hardware I want. <br>

                    RTOS: <br>
                    The BBBW has an RTOS Debian Linux already established for it. Linux is friendlier when it comes to
                    modifying its OS features and making drivers (or so my research is suggesting). However, I have yet
                    to use Linux for any development purposes. This will be a completely new experience for me. My goal
                    with it would be to modify it to boot directly to the customer’s software and only have access to
                    the OS through special "developer debug" access. <br>

                    Screen/Keyboard: <br>
                    I’ve found a smaller sized screen with capacitive touch which would make for an ideal mobile
                    display, but it would be too small for a digital keyboard. But with some searching (BlackBerry
                    Keyboard) I’ve come across some people’s (list them) work one the utilization of the BB’s Q10
                    keyboard. I’d like to use it for my own project as well, this way I could incorporate some hardware
                    keys to be pressed during boot to activate some hidden features, or even during the device use to
                    prompt admin access. <br>

                    Wireless Communications: <br>
                    The BBBW already has a Bluetooth and WiFi module on it. This is helpful for faster prototyping and
                    making software which will communicate with a server to export some data for statistics and other
                    customer features, but it’s lacking wireless communication which can be used in conjunction with the
                    physical environment. One of the first puzzles I want to demonstrate with the device is how it can
                    determine which "block" or item is the correct one when it’s placed in the correct location ("choose
                    wisely" kind of situation). To do this I was thinking I could use NFC as the physical puzzles would
                    only require an NFC sticker to be placed under the surface to work. This would also allow the
                    customer to create cheaper, reusable puzzles faster. <br>

                    Battery: <br>
                    It appears that the BBBW has pins to the PMIC which will allow for a 3.7v LiPo to directly connect
                    to it. But when I looked into this further, it appears that direct connect to it was left off
                    intentionally, and that it won’t operate the wireless when powered this way.
                    For safety, and practice with the system’s ADCs (LBO/or BATT pin would make a good battery level
                    sensor pin), I grabbed a power module from adafuit to use a DC/DC boost converter with UPS features
                    to make it feel a bit more like a phone/tablet style device. I’d like to use the BBBW’s own PMIC to
                    power the system via battery, so I’ll have to do more research into how to do so safely in a later
                    date. For now I’ll use this module which I can reuse in other projects too. <br>

                    <h3 id="beginning"> And We’re Off – I will need to expand on this; currently an outline of what’s
                        happened.</h3>
                    <p> Accomplished so far: <br>
                        GPIO Pins research, what is used on the board already by the modules already attached, what is
                        available to use for keyboard and battery communication.<br>
                        Find how to get the LCD into portrait mode and have it automatically boot into portrait mode.
                        This took some learning on how the GUI works with Linux Oss (specifically X11 on debian).
                        I researched and testing the built in WiFi module and learned how to set it up; still need to
                        create a save state of the information to load upon boot.<br>
                        What I have performed so far:
                        <li>Coded the ADC in voltage reading, and battery % remaining calculations; </li>
                        <li>Calculated and created the voltage divider circuit necessary for the battery in module to
                            provide the correct voltage range; </li>
                        <li>Inspected and researched which hardware pin-mux can be modified for IO operations; </li>
                        <li>Designed, developed, and integrated the diagnosis application; </li>
                        <li>Established how to modify core OS drivers to switch the screen into portrait mode for basic
                            driver compliant LCD’s and created instructions for others to do so; </li>
                        <li>Established and collected resources for making an adapter for mobile cell-phone keyboard
                            (BlackBerry Q10 keyboard). </li>
                        <li>Created bootup system modifications necessary to integrate a Matrix Keyboard into the OS
                            applicable hardware; </li>
                        <li>Established code necessary for wireless communications; </li>
                        <li>Tested and verified each hardware module communicates with the OS appropriately – however
                            not all at the same time so far; </li>
