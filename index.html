                    <a name="aboutMe"> </a>
                    <h2 class="aboutMeTitle">Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
                    <p>My journey into the world of electronics began at the age of 7, when I eagerly dismantled radio-controlled cars to unravel their mysteries. By the time I turned 14, I had built my first computer and actively participated in my school's electronics club. My thirst for knowledge led me to seize opportunities such as the College Now program, offered by my high school, to continuously expand my skills.</p>
                    <p>Following my passion, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Technology-Computers from DeVry University, where I gained a solid foundation in embedded systems software engineering. Seeking to further enhance my expertise, I embarked on a transformative educational experience at the University of Colorado Boulder, earning a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Embedded Systems Engineering.</p>
                    <p>Equipped with a robust skill set, I am an experienced embedded systems software engineer with a proven track record of designing and implementing robust solutions for diverse applications, including consumer electronics, automotive electronics, and industrial automation. Proficient in embedded C/C++, real-time operating systems, and hardware-software integration, I excel at delivering efficient and scalable embedded software solutions. My commitment to professional growth is evident in my ability to earn a Master's degree while working full-time, enhancing my skills in collaborating cross-functionally and translating complex requirements into optimized software solutions.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my career, I have successfully troubleshooted intricate hardware-software integration issues and delivered innovative embedded solutions that leverage the latest technologies, ensuring high performance and reliability. I possess expertise in designing customized embedded systems, full-stack and IoT integration, system architecture, performance optimization, communication protocols, embedded software testing, version control, and debugging complex hardware-software issues.</p>
                    <p>In my current role as a Software Engineer at Radio Sound, Inc., I am at the forefront of designing cutting-edge embedded software for automotive infotainment systems. I collaborate cross-functionally to translate complex requirements into optimized solutions, pioneering agile practices and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) to accelerate feature delivery and improve software quality. I have a proven ability to optimize resource utilization, establish comprehensive test frameworks, and proactively resolve challenges related to real-time performance and hardware-software integration.</p>
                    <p>Beyond my professional endeavors, I am driven by a genuine passion for electronics. During my downtime, I continue to explore and apply my knowledge to personal projects, further honing my skills and staying at the forefront of technological advancements.</p>
                    <p>I am always eager to contribute my expertise, collaborative spirit, and innovative mindset to those who share the same passion, and I look forward to pushing the boundaries of embedded systems software engineering and driving impactful solutions.</p>
